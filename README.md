# NVD-CVE-Analyzer
Welcome to the NVD-CVE-Analyzer, a robust tool engineered in Python for efficient vulnerability searching and identification. I created and designed this tool to integrate seamlessly with the National Vulnerability Database's CVE v2.0 API. It fetches targeted product vulnerability data, adhering to the CPE v2.3 standard, for precise vulnerability assessment.

## Key Features
**Efficient Scanning:** Leverages advanced features of the National Vulnerability Database.

**Targeted Data Fetch:** Utilizes the CPE v2.3 standard to accurately identify vulnerabilities by vendor, product, and version.

**Open Source:** Distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
