# CVE_Vulnerability_Scanner
This repository is home to a useful, open-source CVE Scanner tool engineered to perform efficient vulnerability scanning and identification. The scanner leverages the advanced features of the National Vulnerability Database's CVE v2.0 API and fetches targeted product data based on the CPE v2.3 standard for accurate risk assessment.

# API Key Configuration File: "api_key.txt"
Purpose:
- Upon running the "NVD-CVE-Daemon_PROD_v1.0.py" the console will request you to provide an API Key granted from the NIST National Vulnerability Database.

Acquire API Key:
- If you do not have an API Key you can get one from here: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

Configuring "api_key.txt":
- After providing the API key a crucial configuration file named "api_key.txt" will be created in the same directory as NVD-CVE-Daemon_PROD_v1.0.py. This file is vital for various functionalities within the application that rely on NVD CVE v2.0 API.

Alternative: 
- You can manually create an empty "api_key.txt" file without an API key. However, note that the API request rate will be limited to 5 requests per rolling 30-second window due to NVD's rate-limiting policy.

:warning: Security Precautions: 
- Do not commit "api_key.txt" with your actual API key to any public repositories. Ensure that api_key.txt is listed in your .gitignore file.

# NVD-CVE-Daemon Configuration File: "cpe_versions.txt"
This repository includes a required configuration file named "cpe_versions.txt". This file is essential for the NVD-CVE-Daemon to operate correctly.

Purpose:
- The "cpe_versions.txt" file is used as input by the NVD-CVE-Daemon to fetch vulnerabilities against the National Vulnerability Database for the specified products.

Formatting:
- The contents of the "cpe_versions.txt" file must adhere strictly to the CPE v2.3 dictionary formatting guidelines.

:warning: Important:
- The filename must remain as "cpe_versions.txt".

How to Modify:
1. Locate the File: Navigate to the directory where cpe_versions.txt is stored. (Same directory as NVD-CVE-Daemon_PROD_v1.0.py)
2. Edit: Open the file in a text editor of your choice.
3. Modify: Update the content based on the CPE v2.3 dictionary format.
4. Save: Save your changes.

# Managing "date.yml" File for Time-bound API Queries
Purpose:
- The "date.yml" file plays a crucial role in setting the time frame for API queries when you run the application. By default, the application searches for data up to 90 days ago from today's date.

File Creation & Update:
- Initial Run: On the first successful run of the program, a "date.yml" file will be automatically created. The file will contain the date of the last successful run.
- Subsequent Runs: Each time you run the application successfully, the "date.yml" file will get updated with the new "last run date."

:warning: Customization:
- Manual Edit: You can manually edit the date.yml file to specify a different start date for the API query. However, the date should be within 90 days from today's date.
Limitations
- API Error: Setting a date older than 90 days will result in an API error, as the API is constrained to function only within a 90-day window.
By adhering to these guidelines, you can efficiently manage the "date.yml" file and ensure the smooth operation of time-bound API queries.
